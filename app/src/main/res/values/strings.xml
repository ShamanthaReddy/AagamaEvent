    <string name="about">I\'d recommed this one, mostly because its based in the original textview from the android official sdk, which in my personal opinion it is a way more lighter than the webviews technique many people is posting regarding this common topic. If you building a app that needs to be memory wise, using listview objects for example, you might consider using something like this. √è allready try it out, and works as expected. If you people know another one better o like this 1, please you might share you experience with me.</string>
